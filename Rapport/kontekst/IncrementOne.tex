Test om: Bounce, predefined area
Skal komme væk fra accelerotmeter og gyroscope. 

\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:i1Requirements}
The requirements which will be considered in this increment is mark with a blue colour.

\begin{itemize}
\item The trash bin should catch the trash if the user throws it towards the trash bin and within a predefined area
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The robots predefined area should be calculated from the hardware limitations of the motors’ speed}
\end{itemize}
\item The robot should know where it is positioned
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The robot should have a starting position, from where it should be able to calculate it's current position}
\end{itemize}
\item The robot should be able to detect and track the thrown trash
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The thrown trash should be detected and tracked by a Microsoft Kinect}
\item The Kinect should send the coordinates of the impact point of the trash to the robot
\end{itemize}
\item The robot should know where the the thrown trash will land
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Trajectory prediction should be used to calculate impact point of the thrown trash}
%\item \textcolor{red}{The trajectory prediction should include a bounce prediction}
%\item \textcolor{red}{The bounce-shot should be thrown from a designated side of the camera}
%\item \textcolor{red}{The bounce-shot should bounce into the predefined area where the robot should catch the trash within }
\end{itemize}
\item The robot should be able to move the trash bin, such that the thrown trash lands inside the bin
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The robot should be able to turn, drive forward and drive backwards with a certain speed}
\item Multiple trash thrown should not be considered
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

These requirements are rudimentary, and the very essence of the project lies within the fulfilment of these requirements. In this increment the fundamentals of the robot’s movement should be implemented, the predefined area should be calculated, a starting point for this area should be determined and the Microsoft Kinect should be able to detect and track an object with the use of trajectory prediction.
