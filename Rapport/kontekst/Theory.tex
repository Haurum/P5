\section{Trajectory prediction}
\label{sec:Trajectory prediction}
When the trash, referred to in this section as the projectile, is detected and the tracking of that projectile has started, the trajectory can be predicted. This prediction is limited to the amount of data sent by the sensory camera, meaning that for every camera reading, one detection of the object is gained. The precision of the prediction will increase according to the time a projectile has been tracked. In this project, since the prediction is done indoor, the outdoor weather conditions that might affect the projectile trajectory is not considered. As well, the effects of air resistance, also called drag, will not be considered. \newline
The trajectory of a projectile is the path of a thrown projectile without propulsion, affected by gravity. For calculating a trajectory of a projectile, the initial height, the angle which the projectile is launced from, the speed of the projectile at launch and the gravitational acceleration must be taken into account. The initial height in this project is the height at which the projectile is detected, and the angle and speed at which the projectile is launched will be calculated from the first few trackings after detecting the projectile. The gravitational acceleration is considered as \(9.81m/s^2\), which is the standard near the earths surface. \newline
In this project we are interested in catching the projectile, and to do that, we need to calculate the distance the projectile travels before hitting the ground, and the amount of time before the projectile hits the ground. This is done with two mathematical formulas: \newline
\newline 
\begin{math}
g: \ the \ gravitational \ acceleration \ (9.81m/s^2)\newline
\theta: \ the \ angle \ at \ launch 
v: \ the \ speed \ at \ launch\newline
y_{0}: \ the \ initial \ height\newline
d: \ the \ total \ horizontal \ distance \ traveled \ \newline
t: \ the \ time \ of \ flight\newline
v_{vert}: \ the \ vertical \ velocity\newline
v_{hori}: \ the \ horizontal \ velocity\newline
t_{h}: \ the \ time \ since \ first \ detection\newline
d_{t}: \ the \ distance \ at \ time \ t\newline
\end{math}

From these variables we can express the formulas needed to provide the total distance traveled by the projectile, and the amount of time this would take.\newline
The distance traveled is:
\[d = \dfrac{v \ cos \ \theta}{g}(v \ sin \ \theta + \sqrt{(v \ sin \ \theta)^2 \ + \ 2gy_{0}})\] \newline
The time of flight is:
\[t = \dfrac{d}{v \ cos \ \theta} = \dfrac{v \ sin \ \theta \ + \ \sqrt{(v \ sin \ \theta)^2 \ + \ 2gy_{0}}}{g}\]
\newline

To calculate a trajectory of the projectile, the altitude and distance of the projectile at any time during the flight must be calculated, according to the initial height ( \(y_{0}\) ):
\[y = v_{vert}t - \dfrac{1}{2} gt^2\]
\[d_{t} = v_{hori}t\]\newline

After this section, the projectile can be tracked, and the path for a given projectile can be calculated to a certain degree of correctness.
