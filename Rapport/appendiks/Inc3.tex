\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:i3Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The trash bin should catch the trash if the user throws it towards the trash bin and within a predefined area
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {The robots predefined area should be calculated from the hardware limitations of the motorsâ€™ speed}
	\end{itemize}
	\item The robot should know where it is positioned
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {The robot should have a starting position, from where it should be able to calculate it's current position through calculations of the motor encoders}
		\item {The robot's starting point should be placed outside its predefined area, such that it moves forward into the area}
	\end{itemize}
	\item The robot should be able to detect and track the thrown trash
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {The thrown trash should be detected and tracked by a Microsoft Kinect}
		\item {The Kinect should send the coordinates of the impact point of the trash to the robot}
	\end{itemize}
	\item The robot should know where the the thrown trash will land
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {Trajectory prediction should be used to calculate impact point of the thrown trash}
	\end{itemize}
	\item The robot should be able to move the trash bin, such that the thrown trash lands inside the bin
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {The robot should be able to turn and drive forward}
		\item\textcolor{blue}{The robot should be able to recognize the coordinates sent from the Kinect}
	\end{itemize}
	\item {The robot should be able to receive data from a computer, through a wireless network}
\end{itemize}
