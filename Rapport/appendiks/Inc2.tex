\section{System design}
\label{sec:i2System design} 
In this section, the marked requirements should be fulfilled and will be described and explained.  

\subsection{Wifi Shield}
\label{sec:Wifi Shield SD}
When the Kinect have found the coordinates for the collision point of the thrown object, these coordinates should be sent to the robot, for it to be able to move to the collision point and catch the object. 
The data should be sent, as earlier mentioned in section \ref{sec: Arduino Wifi Shield}, to the Arduino wifi shield. The Arduino and the computer running the Kinect program should be connected to their own network, with the computer sending data to the wifi shields IP-address.

\subsection{Robot positioning}
\label{sec:Robot positioning System Design}
In the previous chapter, it was decided to use the motor's encoders to calculate the heading of the robot and the distance it has moved. The encoders will keep track of the number of degrees the specific motor have turned, which can be calculated to a distance using the wheels circumference.
The coordinate set for the collision point of the object and the robots current position, will be used to calculate the heading, which the robot should have to reach the collision point. 

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:i2Implementation}
This section explains how the marked requirements were actually implemented in the project and whether or not the requirements have been changed, removed or been fulfilled. 

\subsection{Wifi Shield}
\label{sec:Wifi Shield Implementation}
To implement the Wifi Shield as part of the Arduino, the router connecting the Wifi Shield with a computer had to be port forwarded. The private network hosted by the D-link router had a specific ssid and password, which had to be explicitly assigned in the Arduino code for the Wifi Shield. The setup in the Arduino code was used to start the connection between the computer and the Wifi Shield, as well as printing the log of the connection. The setup for the wifi shield can be found in listing \ref{ws}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Connecting the Wifi shield to the network}, label={ws}]
void setup() {
Serial.begin(9600);

Serial.println("Attempting to connect to WPA network...");
status = WiFi.begin(ssid, pass);

if ( status != WL_CONNECTED) { 
Serial.println("Couldn't get a wifi connection");
while(true);
} 
else {
server.begin();
Serial.println("Connected to network");
}
ip = WiFi.localIP();
Serial.println(ip);
}
\end{lstlisting}

After connecting the Wifi Shield to the router, the Arduino is ready to receive data. The data will be sent from a laptop, which connects and sends data as shown in \ref{cws}. A tcpClient is created and connected to the IP of the Wifi Shield, and the port that has been forwarded. The data sent in the code is a string "test", which is sent as a byte-array, and after sending the data, the tcpClient closes the connection.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Connecting the computer to the Wifi Shield}, label={cws}]
tcpClient.Connect("192.168.0.100", 9999);
string data = "test";
const int IntSize = 4;
byte[] bytedata;
Stream stream = tcpClient.GetStream();

stream.Write(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data.ToCharArray()), 0, data.Length);
tcpClient.Close();
\end{lstlisting}

When both the computer and the Wifi shield has made the connection, and the computer has sent the data, the Arduino can then receive the data. This is done through a Wifi client, from the Arduino Wifi library. When assigning the client to the server.available, the value of the client in an if-statement would be true if any client from the server has data available for reading, or false if no data was available. If a client is connected, and the client has data available for reading, the next byte will be appended on the string readString, and after all the data available has been read, the full string sent by the client will be printed.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Receiving data from the computer}, label={rdc}]
client = server.available();
while (client.connected()){
if (client.available()) {
char c = client.read(); 
readString += c;
}
}
if(readString != ""){
Serial.println(readString);
readString = "";
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Robot positioning}
\label{sec:Robot positioning Implementation}
In the top of the Arduino program, a lot of variables were declared, which can be seen in listing \ref{declarations}. The two volatile integers leftTotal and rightTotal are used to count the number of degrees the motor have turned. leftTotal and rightTotal are volatile integers because the value of the variables can be changed by other things than the code, which in this case is the motors. \newline
motorLeftRun and motorRighRun are booleans used to check whether the motors are running or not. \newline
The variable called heading have the value of the robot's heading, which in this project will be the degrees the robot's direction is pointing away from the y-axis of its predefined area. Then robot's current position will be saved as coordinates in the variables posX and posY. \newline
Several integers are declared which will get further explanation later in the section. 
Also in the top of the program some identifiers have been defined and the necessary libraries have been included to the program.  

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The defined and declared variables}, label={declarations}]
volatile int leftTotal = 0;
volatile int rightTotal = 0;
bool motorLeftRun = false;
bool motorRightRun = false;
double heading = 0.0, posX = 0.0, posY = 0.0;
unsigned int tid;
int leftTemp, rightTemp, goalX = 230, goalY = 330, margin = 10, loopcount = 0, signalCount = 0;
\end{lstlisting}

An arduino program is split up into a setup function and a loop function, where the code in the loop function should describe the robot's behaviour. The setup function are run once for every power up or reset of the Arduino board.
The setup function can be found in listing \ref{setup}. Two pins are setup as inputs for the arduino board and an interrupt is attached to each of them. Every time a change occurs for the input pins, which in this case is every time the motors have turned 1 degree, the functions incrementLeft and incrementRight are called accordingly. The two functions increments the counters leftTotal and rightTotal which are counting the number of degrees the motors have turned. \newline
Next up the motors are turned on. This is done by setting their speed, which here is set to the highest speed possible, and then both motors are ret to RELEASE, which will stop the motors. Also the booleans motorLeftRun and motorRightRun are set to false. \newline
At the bottom of the setup funtion, then leftTotal's and the rightTotal's values have been assigned to the temporary variables leftTemp and rightTemp.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The setup function}, label={setup}]'
pinMode(LEFTENCODERPIN, INPUT);
attachInterrupt(LEFTPINTOINTERRUPT, incrementLeft, CHANGE);
pinMode(RIGHTENCODERPIN, INPUT);
attachInterrupt(RIGHTPINTOINTERRUPT, incrementRight, CHANGE);

motorLeft.setSpeed(255);
motorRight.setSpeed(255);

motorLeft.run(RELEASE);
motorLeftRun = false;
motorRight.run(RELEASE);
motorRightRun = false;

leftTemp = leftTotal;
rightTemp = rightTotal;
\end{lstlisting}

When the arduino program enters the loop function, seen in listing \ref{loop}, the first thing it will do is to check the if-statement at line. This if-statement checks if the robot is at its desired position, which is the coordinate set sent from the Kinect(goalX and goalY). If the robot was at the position it will release both motors and exit the program, else it will skip this if statement and continue in the loop function. \newline
In lines 9-12 the difference of the desired coordinate and the current coordinate of the robot are calculated and assigned to the variables deltaY and deltaX. With these new variables the heading of which the robot should have to hit the desired point. The delta heading are calculated using the goalHeading and the current heading of the robot.\newline
In lines 14 - 23 the if-else statement checks if the robot is on the right heading. If the robot's heading is less than -0.1 it will release the right motor and drive forward with the left, making the robot turn right. The robot will do the same check for 0.1 and will release the left motor and drive forward on the right, making the robot turn left. If the robot is on its right heading, it will drive forward, towards it desired point. \newline
In lines 25-35 two new integers, currentLeft and currentRight, are assigned the values of leftTotal and rightTotal. Then the distance of how much the wheels have moved since last time it was looped through is calculated. This is done by taking the difference of currentLeft and leftTemp times DISTPRDEGREE, which was defined at the beginning of the program, the same is done with currentRight and tempRight. Then leftTemp and rightTemp are assigned the values of currentLeft and currentRight. \newline
The distance the robot have moved is the average of how much the two motors have moved, so the the distances of the two motors are added together and divided by two. With the distance, the robots new current position is calculated assigned to the values posX and posY, and the new heading for the robot.


\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The loop function}, label={loop}]
void loop() {
if(round(posX) <= goalX + margin && round(posX) >= goalX - margin &&     round(posY) <= goalY + margin && round(posY) >= goalY - margin){
motorLeft.run(RELEASE);
motorRight.run(RELEASE);
delay(50);
exit(0);
}

double deltaX = goalX - posX;
double deltaY = goalY - posY;
double goalHeading = atan(deltaX/deltaY);
double deltaHeading = goalHeading - heading;

if(deltaHeading < -0.1){
motorLeft.run(FORWARD);
motorRight.run(RELEASE);
}else if(deltaHeading > 0.1){
motorLeft.run(RELEASE);
motorRight.run(FORWARD);
}else{
motorLeft.run(FORWARD);
motorRight.run(FORWARD);
}

delay(10);
int currentLeft = leftTotal;
int currentRight = rightTotal;
double deltaLeft = (currentLeft - leftTemp) * DISTPRDEGREE;
double deltaRight = (currentRight - rightTemp) * DISTPRDEGREE;
leftTemp = currentLeft;
rightTemp = currentRight;
double dist = (deltaLeft + deltaRight) / 2.0;
posX += (dist * sin(heading));
posY += (dist * cos(heading));
heading += (atan((deltaRight - deltaLeft) / WHEELDIST));
}
\end{lstlisting}
